# Board Game Rulebook

### Game Overview

* Two teams operate opposing submarines, battling for control of the ocean depths.
* Each teammate has a specific station and responsibilities.
* Effective coordination and communication are crucial for survival.
* Two game modes: Real-time and Turn-by-Turn (turn-by-turn recommended for beginners or noisy environments).

### Winning the Game

* The first team to take 4 damage loses. The other team wins.
* Advanced scenarios might have additional or replacement objectives.

### Game Setup

1. Place screens in the center of the table.
2. Choose a scenario. Captain and Radio Operator take corresponding sheets.
3. Use the dark side of sheets for real-time mode, light side for turn-by-turn mode.
4. Teams sit on opposite sides of the screens.
5. First Mate and Engineer take corresponding sheets.
6. Radio Operators take transparent sheets.
7. Each player gets an erasable marker.

### Components

* 2 sets of role sheets (yellow and blue teams)
* First Mate, Engineer, Captain, and Radio Operator sheets for each team
* Transparent sheets for Radio Operators
* Erasable marker pens
* Screens

### Team Lineup

* Various player counts (2-8), with roles assigned accordingly. Fewer players mean individuals handle multiple roles.
  * Teams of 4: Each player a different role.
  * Teams of 3: Captain and First Mate are played by one player.
  * Teams of 2: Captain, First Mate and Engineer are played by one player.

### Roles and Responsibilities

#### Captain

* The leader, responsible for guiding the submarine and coordinating the team.
* Determines the starting position of the submarine.
* Announces the course (North, South, East, West).
* Must wait for the First Mate and Engineer to confirm before announcing a new course.
* If blocked, must surface.

#### Radio Operator

* Tracks the enemy submarine by listening to the enemy Captain's announcements.
* Draws the enemy's course on a transparent sheet.
* Estimates the enemy's position based on movements and map features.
* Updates the Captain on the enemy's possible location.
* Uses drones and sonar to narrow down the enemy position.

#### First Mate

* Advances gauges to bring the submarine's systems online (mine, torpedo, drone, sonar, silence, scenario).
* Announces when a system is ready to activate (e.g., "MINE READY").
* Manages the damage taken by the submarine.

#### Engineer

* Tracks breakdowns that occur as the Captain announces courses.
* Crosses out symbols corresponding to the announced course.
* System Breakdown: If a symbol corresponding to a system is crossed out, that system cannot be activated.
* Radiation Breakdowns: When all radiation symbols are crossed out, the submarine suffers 1 damage and all breakdowns are erased.
* Complete Area Breakdown: When all symbols in a control panel are crossed out, the submarine suffers 1 damage and all breakdowns are erased.
* Repairing: Self-repairing in the Central Circuits or by surfacing (see below).

### Surfacing

* A way to repair the submarine and reset the route, but leaves the submarine vulnerable.
* The Captain announces "SURFACE" and the submarine's current sector.
* Turn-by-Turn: The Engineer erases all breakdowns from the submarine. The enemy team takes three turns in a row.
* Real-Time: The Engineer secures the ship by drawing a line around one of the four sections of the submarine, then all teammates do the same, then all breakdowns are erased.
* The Captain resets his route.

### Activating Systems

* The First Mate announces a system when it is ready. The Captain can then activate that system.
* Confirm with the Engineer that there are no breakdowns affecting the system.
* Announce "STOP" and raise a fist (real-time) or activate after a course announcement (turn-by-turn).
* Announce the system to activate.

### System Details

#### Launching a Torpedo

* The Captain launches a torpedo at a space one to four spaces away.
* Announces the point of impact.
* A torpedo impact has the same outcome as a triggered mine.

#### Dropping a Mine

* The Captain drops a mine on a space adjacent to the submarine.
* Cannot drop a mine on the submarineâ€™s route or in a space with its own mine.

#### Triggering a Mine

* The Captain triggers a mine he previously dropped to damage nearby submarines.
* Three possible outcomes: all clear, indirect hit (1 damage), direct hit (2 damage).

#### Launching a Drone

* Asks the enemy Captain if the enemy submarine is located in a particular sector.
* The enemy Captain answers truthfully.

#### Activating Sonar

* The enemy Captain announces two pieces of information about his submarine's location (one true, one false).
* Each piece of information must be of a different type (row, column, or sector).

#### Activating Silence

* The Captain moves his submarine without announcing the route (up to four spaces).

#### Activating the Scenario System

* Function determined by the scenario.

### Scenarios

* **Alpha Map:** Small and numerous islands.
* **Bravo Map:** More open environment, drones and sonar are helpful.
* **Charlie Map:** Small islands and open water. Effective use of mines and stealth.
* **Delta Map:** Below ice. Surfacing in an open water hole is important.
* **Echo Map:** Hacking Archer mines.

### General Advice

* Good communication is key.
* A good Radio Operator is vital.

### End of the Game

* When one submarine has suffered 4 damage, it is destroyed and the game ends. The surviving team wins the game!
